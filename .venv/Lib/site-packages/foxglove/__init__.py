        Each message is a JSON object with a JSON Schema attached to the channel.

        - ``process_memory`` (number): Resident memory used by the SDK process, in bytes.
        - ``process_virtual_memory`` (number): Virtual memory used by the SDK process, in bytes.
        - ``process_cpu_percent`` (number): CPU usage for the SDK process, as a percent of total
          system CPU capacity (0.0 to 100.0).
        - ``process_cpu_cores`` (number): CPU usage for the SDK process, expressed in
          core-equivalents (0.0 to ``num_cpus``). 1.0 means a single logical CPU is fully utilized.
        - ``total_cpu_percent`` (number): Total CPU usage across all logical CPUs on the system,
          as a percent (0.0 to 100.0).
        - ``total_cpu_cores`` (number): Total CPU usage across the system, expressed in
          core-equivalents (0.0 to ``num_cpus``). 1.0 means one logical CPU's worth of work is
          being done.
        - ``num_cpus`` (integer): Number of logical CPUs on the system.
        - ``total_memory`` (number): Total physical memory on the system, in bytes.
        - ``used_memory`` (number): Used physical memory on the system, in bytes.
        - ``total_swap`` (number): Total swap space on the system, in bytes.
        - ``used_swap`` (number): Used swap space on the system, in bytes.
        - ``kernel_version`` (string): Kernel version string, or empty if unknown.
        - ``os_version`` (string): OS version string, or empty if unknown.

        CPU usage values are computed from the difference between consecutive samples, so they
        reflect activity over the most recent refresh interval.

        The caller is responsible for calling stop() on the returned handle when done;
        dropping the handle does not stop the background task.
