    Options for the MCAP writer.

    :param compression: Specifies the compression that should be used on chunks. Defaults to Zstd.
        Pass `None` to disable compression.
    :param profile: Specifies the profile that should be written to the MCAP Header record.
    :param chunk_size: Specifies the target uncompressed size of each chunk. Pass `None` to disable
        the chunk size limit.
    :param use_chunks: Specifies whether to use chunks for storing messages.
    :param emit_statistics: Specifies whether to write a statistics record in the summary section.
    :param emit_summary_offsets: Specifies whether to write summary offset records.
    :param emit_message_indexes: Specifies whether to write message index records after each chunk.
    :param emit_chunk_indexes: Specifies whether to write chunk index records in the summary
        section.
    :param disable_seeking: Specifies whether to disable seeking backwards/forwards when writing.
        Use this when writing to a non-seekable file-like object (e.g. a wrapped pipe or network
        socket). The seek() implementation must still support `seek(0, SEEK_CUR)` and
        `seek(current_position, SEEK_SET)`.
    :param repeat_channels: Specifies whether to repeat each channel record from the data section
        in the summary section.
    :param repeat_schemas: Specifies whether to repeat each schema record from the data section in
        the summary section.
    :param calculate_chunk_crcs: Specifies whether to calculate and write CRCs for chunk records.
    :param calculate_data_section_crc: Specifies whether to calculate and write a data section CRC
        into the DataEnd record.
    :param calculate_summary_section_crc: Specifies whether to calculate and write a summary section
        CRC into the Footer record.
    :param calculate_attachment_crcs: Specifies whether to calculate and write CRCs for attachment
        records.
    :param compression_level: Specifies the compression level to use. 0 means use the compressor
        default.
    :param compression_threads: Specifies how many threads to use for zstd compression. None uses
        the number of physical CPUs. 0 disables multithreaded compression.
